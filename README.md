# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Mall Customers dataset. The goal is to group customers based on their annual income and spending score, helping businesses gain insights into customer behavior. The project begins with data exploration and applies the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters. Once determined, K-Means is used to classify customers into five distinct groups, which are then visualized using scatter plots with cluster centroids highlighted. The implementation leverages Python with libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data handling, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning. This analysis can support data-driven decision-making in areas like marketing, customer relationship management, and personalized business strategies.
